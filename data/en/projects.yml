  body: "A part-time small business dedicated to crafting custom vacations for travellers, I started Place I Know with the goal of making travel as hassle-free as possible.</p><p>The backend was originally developed using Ruby and Sinatra. It is currently in the process of being migrated to a Node.js backend with the goal of decoupling the architecture into microservices. The frontend is currently being migrated to a responsive, speedy React.js application.</p><p>The iOS app, written with Swift, features offline itinerary access, realtime chat with a travel planner, and offline maps from Mapbox."

  body: "Divvy, the bike-sharing system in Chicago, releases anonymized trip information twice a year for anyone to analyze. This project, a two-time winner in the 2015 Divvy Data Challenge, compares the median observed trip time between every Divvy station pair and compares it to the same trip by public transportation. The result? It looks like most Divvy trips are faster than public transportation – suggesting bike-share in Chicago is a great addition to the way people move in the city.</p><p>The data was analyzed using PHP scripts that updated information in a SQL database. In order to get trip times via public transportation, the Google Maps API was called for every station pair using a PHP script. To build the visualization, I used the d3.js JavaScript library. The map in the pop-up was created using the Mapbox JavaScript library. Finally, making it pretty was done with good old CSS.</p><p>Won Best Overall Visualization and Most Insightful in the 2015 Divvy Data Challenge.

  body: "The Chicago Building Age Map uses data from the City of Chicago to display the age of construction for many of the city's hundreds of thousands of buildings. Inspired by similar projects in other cities, this map gives anyone the ability to see the history of their city visually. Filtering the map by years gives us an insight into how the city developed – from its 19th century core to the newer skyscrapers of the Loop."
